### Nintendont-2PMod-Fix
A patched version of Nintendont to work with the 2P-ShdTH project.

***ONLY FOR VERSIONS 2.0 - 2.2***!!!


### Quick Installation:
1. Get the [loader.dol](loader/loader.dol?raw=true), rename it to boot.dol and put it in /apps/Nintendont2PMod/ along with the files [meta.xml](nintendont/meta.xml?raw=true) and [icon.png](nintendont/icon.png?raw=true).
2. Copy your built 2P-ShdTH 2.0+ ISO to the /games/ directory. Subdirectories are optional for 1-disc games in ISO/GCM and CISO format.
   * For extracted FST, the FST must be located in a subdirectory, e.g. /games/FSTgame/sys/boot.bin .
